\* resolve_host (P-RESOLVE-HOST): the connection's host is authoritative for the
\* community, exactly as a relay URL is authoritative for the relay today, lifted
\* one level up to community.  A host maps to exactly one community, or to the
\* NoCommunity sentinel (an unmapped/unknown host) -> the connection fails closed
\* and no channel-less write may derive a community from it.  This is the upstream
\* of ResolveTenant: ctx.community is *derived* from the host, never free-chosen.
\*
\* Stated assumption (P-HOST-APPEND): HostCommunity is a CONSTANT-per-segment
\* function even though the operator plane (POST /operator/communities) can
\* provision new communities at runtime.  The host map is append-only —
\* ensure_configured_community's upsert (ON CONFLICT (lower(host)) DO UPDATE
\* SET host = EXCLUDED.host RETURNING id) returns the SAME community id for an
\* already-bound host and no code path re-points an existing binding — so a
\* provisioning event only extends the function's domain with a fresh
\* host |-> community pair.  Every behavior TLC checks over the fixed
\* HostA/HostB/HostBad harness therefore remains valid across provisioning:
\* new hosts are new constant assignments for subsequent behavior, never
\* mutations of the bindings modeled here.  The authorization obligations of
\* the operator plane itself (allowlist gate, payload binding, rotation
\* confinement) live in the Tamarin model (MultiTenantAuth.spthy S9, with the
\* append-only assumption imported as the UniqueHostBinding restriction); see
\* docs/multi-tenant-relay.md SS-Conformance (P-HOST-APPEND).
HostCommunity == [h \in Hosts |->

\* Channel-or-sentinel: data rows and write/observation records may be channel-
\* less (channel = NoChannel), in which case the community comes from the host.
ChannelsExt == Channels \cup {NoChannel}

\* Every accepted write and recorded duplicate stamps its real originating host
\* (host \in Hosts): channel-less writes resolve the community from the host, and
\* channel-bearing writes/duplicates stamp the host on agreement (fail-closed on
\* disagreement, so no record carries a host that does not map to its community).
\* This lets Inv_HostBindingFence check that every record's stored community equals
\* its host's mapping -- i.e. the binding is enforced, not defaulted.

\* SAFETY PROPERTIES

\* NI (master): no observation scoped to community C may be influenced by a row,
\* projection, audit head, auth decision, write-conflict source, or error source
\* labeled outside C. This is the single-run label/taint encoding of the
\* two-execution non-interference theorem.
Inv_NonInterference ==

\* derived from the dependencies each observation can reveal.

        /\ (o.kind = "AuthVerdict" => o.labels = {ChannelCommunity(o.channel)} /\ o.community = ChannelCommunity(o.channel))

\* I1 read confinement follows from NI + label propagation, but is kept as a

\* I2 resolution fence: persisted messages and write/auth observations are
\* labeled by the *resolved* community, never a client-supplied claim.  For a
\* channel-bearing op the resolver is the server-owned channel->community mapping
\* (the h tag is not the source).  For a channel-less op (channel = NoChannel) the
\* resolver is the connection's host (P-RESOLVE-HOST): the stamped community is a
\* real community derived from the host, never the NoCommunity sentinel and never
\* the adversary-controlled claimedCommunity.  At N=1 (one host -> one community)
\* the two branches coincide.

\* I2-host fail-closed binding: EVERY accepted write -- channel-bearing or
\* channel-less -- AND every observable duplicate/no-op outcome carries the host it
\* came in on, and that host's mapping is a real community equal to the write's
\* stored community (P-RESOLVE-HOST).  For channel-less writes this is the
\* host->community derivation; for channel-bearing writes and duplicate/no-op
\* outcomes it is the host/channel agreement fence (HostCommunity[host] =
\* ChannelCommunity(ch)).  This makes BOTH "an unmapped host defaults to a tenant"
\* and "an A-host can drive a B-channel op (insert OR duplicate-probe)" CAUGHT
\* mutations: the fail-closed branches of WriteInsert/WriteInsertGlobal/WriteDuplicate
\* write/record nothing on disagreement, so no accepted write and no recorded
\* duplicate can carry a host whose mapping is NoCommunity or disagrees with the stamp.

\* Channel-community immutability: a runtime-created channel may be stamped at
