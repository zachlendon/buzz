/**
 * Per-row subtree unread counts for the in-panel thread summary rows. A
 * collapsed branch's badge counts unread replies anywhere beneath it; the
 * count is omitted for expanded branches (suppress-on-expand happens here,
 * upstream of the panel, so the panel needs no gate) and for rows with zero
 * unread descendants (no "0" badge).
 *
 * Unread is measured against the open-time frontier snapshot — the same
 * boundary the in-thread divider uses — so the mark-read-on-open advance does
 * not zero the badges the instant the panel opens. A null frontier (thread
 * never read) treats every subtree reply as unread.
 *
 * @param subtreeReplyIds Descendant reply ids of the open thread head. Scoping
 *   the unread set to this subtree keeps one thread's frontier from marking
 *   replies that belong to a different thread.
 * @param visibleReplyIds Ids of the rows actually rendered in the panel; only
 *   these are keyed, keeping the map consistent with row presence.
 * @param expandedSubtreeReplyIds Reply ids beneath any expanded row. Expanding
 *   a branch persistently marks its whole subtree read (mark-read-on-expand),
 *   so those replies are dropped from the unread set — otherwise a revealed
 *   child would carry a stale badge for a reply the same gesture just read.
