/**
 * Pure projection that pulls agent-authored replies addressed to a human up to
 * the thread root. The channel timeline only renders root-level entries
 * (`buildMainTimelineEntries` keeps `parentId == null || broadcast`), so an
 * agent's reply to a human posted *nested* is invisible where the human reads.
 * This function returns the nested messages that should be surfaced as
 * lightweight root-level pointers; the real message is never moved or copied —
 * the caller (Phase 2) renders a pointer row that links down to it.
 *
 * Lives in `.mjs` (not `.ts`) so the test runner (`node --test`, no TS loader)
 * imports the same source production uses; TypeScript callers get types from
 * the sibling `.d.mts`.

/**
 * A message is root-level — and therefore needs no surfacing — under the exact

 * reply. Inlined (not imported from `threading.ts`) because that module is

 * line and must stay identical to `buildMainTimelineEntries`'s filter.

/**
 * Returns the subset of `messages` to surface as root-level pointers.
 *
 * A nested message surfaces iff ALL hold:
 *   1. it is not already root-level (root needs no surfacing);
 *   2. its author is an agent — `isHuman(authorPubkey) === false`;
 *   3. it carries a p-tag for the VIEWER — a `["p", viewerPubkey]`. Surfacing
 *      exists to pull replies addressed to the reader up where their eye is, so
 *      only the reader's own buried replies qualify; an agent CC'ing another
 *      human is that other human's signal, not noise in the reader's timeline.
 *
 * `viewerPubkey` FAILS CLOSED: when it is null/undefined (no resolvable reader)
 * NOTHING surfaces. Over-surfacing is the defect this guards against, so an
 * unknown viewer must surface nothing rather than fall back to "any human".
 *
 * De-dupe is STRICT and THREAD-SCOPED: a candidate is skipped only when a
 * root-level message *in the same thread* has the EXACT SAME body. Author
 * identity is irrelevant — an agent's earlier, unrelated root-level post must
 * not suppress a genuinely new nested reply. Scoping by thread prevents a root
 * "done" in thread A from suppressing a nested "done" in thread B; short common
 * bodies collide constantly across a busy channel. The key is
 * `${threadId}\u0000${body}` where a message's thread id is `rootId ?? id` (a
 * root's own thread id is its `id`, since its `rootId` is null) and `\u0000`
 * (NUL) cannot appear in an event id or normal body, so keys never collide.
 *
 * Empty/whitespace-only bodies carry no content that can "already exist" at
 * root, so they are never seeded and never suppress — every such candidate that
 * passes the trigger conditions surfaces.
 *
 * `isHuman` is authoritative as given. The caller resolves unknown
 * classification to `true` (human), so an unrecognized author is treated human
 * and fails condition (2): the message under-surfaces rather than mis-surfaces.
