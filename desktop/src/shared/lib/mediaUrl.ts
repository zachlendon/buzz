/**
 * Rewrite relay media URLs to use the localhost streaming proxy.

 * WKWebView's networking stack bypasses WARP, so direct <img src> requests

 * fetches through the Rust backend (via reqwest), which goes through WARP.
 *
 * For video, the proxy streams via axum — no buffering the entire file.
 * Images and other media also benefit from this path.
 *
 * Only URLs hosted on the Buzz relay are rewritten. External Blossom URLs
 * (e.g. nostr.build, void.cat) are returned unchanged — they aren't behind
 * Cloudflare Access and can be loaded directly by WKWebView. Without this
 * origin check, external Blossom URLs would be proxied to the wrong server
 * (the Buzz relay), resulting in 404s.
