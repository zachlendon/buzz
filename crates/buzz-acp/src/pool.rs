    // it is identical across channels; the per-channel cache just avoids a
    // re-fetch on each new session and is cleared on session invalidation.

    //   * no owner configured → skip (no NIP-AE namespace exists)

    //     learns how to bootstrap itself.

    //     mistake "relay slow or broken" for "no core" — that would invite
    //     the agent to overwrite real, just-unreachable memory.
    //   * fetch exceeds CORE_FETCH_TIMEOUT → inject nothing, same reason.

// `select!` arm in `run_prompt_task`: it lives and dies with the prompt future,
// so emission stops on every exit path (complete / cancel / error / panic) with
// no separate teardown to forget.
//
// Takes a captured `ObserverHandle` rather than `&agent.acp` because the prompt
// future holds `&mut agent.acp` for its whole duration — a second borrow would
// not compile.
