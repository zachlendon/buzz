//! buzz-db — Postgres event store for Buzz.
//!
//! ## Design invariants
//! - AUTH events (kind 22242) are never stored — they carry bearer tokens.
//! - Ephemeral events (20000–29999) are never stored — Redis pub/sub only.
//! - Events table is partitioned by month on `created_at`.
//! - No FK references to partitioned tables.
//! - Uses `sqlx::query()` (runtime) not `sqlx::query!()` (compile-time).
