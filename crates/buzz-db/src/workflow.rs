    // -- F1 / S1 attack surface for scheduled workflow claims ------------------
    //
    // These tests pin the locked spec from Eva [13] / Mari [12]:
    //
    //   1. `workflows.community_id` is row-owned, NOT NULL, immutable.
    //   2. Claim resolves `community_id` server-side via `workflow_id`.
    //   3. Claim uniqueness is `(workflow_id, scheduled_for)` — `workflow_id`
    //      is globally unique, so adding `community_id` to the key weakens it.
    //   4. `latest_scheduled_workflow_fire` drops caller-supplied community.
    //
    // Until that lands, `claim_for_workflow_in_other_community_no_ops` is the
    // S1 regression lock: today the schema permits a caller in community A to
    // claim a workflow owned by community B and have `claimed.community_id`
    // come back as A. That is a cross-tenant write surface (Theorem S1,
    // `docs/multi-tenant-relay.md:248`: "the claimed community never appears
    // in this function — only the resolved one").
    //
    // The other two tests are characterization guards: same-window race must
    // yield exactly one claim winner, and the retention primitive's docstring
    // caveat (pruning below the largest interval breaks `latest_*`) is
    // load-bearing for the §5c deployment-config rule Sami flagged.
