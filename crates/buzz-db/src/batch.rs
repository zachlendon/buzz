//! Group-commit batching for plain (non-replaceable, non-reaction) event inserts.
//!
//! At high ingest rates each plain event pays a full synchronous COMMIT (WAL
//! flush; on Aurora, a storage-quorum ack). A single writer task coalesces
//! concurrent inserts into one transaction so one commit amortizes over the
//! whole batch, while each caller still gets its own per-event result.
//!
//! Batching is opportunistic, not timed: the worker takes one request, then
//! drains whatever else is already queued (up to `max_batch`). A lone request
//! under light load flushes immediately with zero added latency; batches only
//! form while a previous transaction is committing.
//!
//! Semantics relative to [`Db::insert_event_with_thread_metadata`]:
//!
//! - **ACK-after-commit.** A caller's future resolves only after the
//!   transaction containing its event has durably committed (or definitively
//!   failed). No caller is ever answered from an uncommitted state.
//! - **Poison isolation, layer 1 (statement time).** Each event runs under a
//!   savepoint; a statement-time failure (FK violation, rejected kind) fails
//!   only that event — its batch-mates commit.
//! - **Poison isolation, layer 2 (commit time).** Deferred constraint
//!   triggers (migrations 0021/0022) fire during COMMIT, after savepoints are
//!   released, so one bad row aborts the whole batch transaction. When COMMIT
//!   fails with a *server-reported* error (the transaction provably aborted
//!   and nothing committed), every request is replayed individually through
//!   the unbatched path so the poison event fails alone.
//! - **Indeterminate commits are not replayed.** A COMMIT failure that does
//!   not prove an abort (connection dropped while awaiting the response) may
//!   have committed server-side. A blind replay would misreport durable
//!   inserts as duplicates and skip their mentions, so every caller instead
//!   receives [`DbError::CommitOutcomeUnknown`]. Client retries are safe:
//!   event inserts are idempotent (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` → `duplicate:`).
//! - **Mentions stay outside the event transaction**, exactly as the
//!   unbatched wrapper does today: after commit, each newly inserted event's
//!   mentions insert runs on the pool (log-and-succeed), and the caller is
//!   answered only after its own mentions attempt.
//!
//! Shutdown: `mpsc::Receiver::recv` keeps yielding buffered requests after
//! all senders drop and returns `None` only once the queue is empty, so the
//! worker drains naturally. If the worker is gone, [`EventWriteBatcher::
//! insert_event_with_thread_metadata`] returns `None` and the caller falls
//! back to the direct insert path — a dead batcher degrades to today's
//! behavior, it never hangs an ingest future.
