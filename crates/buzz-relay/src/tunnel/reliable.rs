//! Reliable-stream tunnel routing for berd ↔ goose-server sessions.
//!
//! This module owns the relay-side session decision for `Profile::ReliableStream`:
//! first join acquires the Redis fenced lease and becomes the owner runtime;
//! later joins on the owner stay local, while later joins on other runtimes open
//! a fenced mesh bi-stream to the owner. The caller remains responsible for the
//! client-facing WebSocket/bridge bytes; this module supplies the routing and
//! mesh-frame discipline shared by that handler.
