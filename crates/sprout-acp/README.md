# sprout-acp

ACP harness that connects AI agents to Sprout. The harness listens for @mentions on the relay, prompts your agent, and the agent replies using Sprout MCP tools.

```
Sprout Relay ──WS──→ sprout-acp ──stdio──→ Your Agent
                                               │
                                          Sprout MCP
                                       (send_message, etc.)
```

Supports any agent that speaks [ACP](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) over stdio: **goose**, **codex** (via [codex-acp](https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp)), **claude code** (via [claude-agent-acp](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp)), and **amp** (via [acp-amp](https://github.com/SuperagenticAI/acp-amp)).

## Prerequisites

- A running Sprout relay (`just relay` or a hosted instance)
- Docker services up (`docker compose up -d`) if running locally
- A Nostr keypair for the agent (see [Generating Keys](#generating-keys))

Build:

```bash
cargo build --release -p sprout-acp -p sprout-mcp-server
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
```

## Generating Keys

Each agent needs a Nostr keypair — this is the agent's identity in Sprout. Use `sprout-admin` to mint one:

```bash
cargo run -p sprout-admin -- mint-token --name "my-agent" --scopes "messages:read,messages:write,channels:read"
```

This prints an `nsec1...` private key and an API token. **Save both immediately — they're shown only once.**

> **Running multiple agents?** Mint a separate keypair for each. Every agent needs its own identity.

## Channels

The harness discovers channels by querying the relay with the agent's authenticated identity.

By default, the harness discovers only channels the agent is a **member** of (`GET /api/channels?member=true`). When the agent is added to a new channel, the membership notification subscription auto-subscribes to it.

**Private channels** require explicit membership. The relay doesn't yet have a REST/event API for managing channel members — this is a known gap. For now, use `create_channel` via the Sprout MCP tools to create new channels (the creator is automatically a member).

## Quick Start (goose)

```bash
export SPROUT_PRIVATE_KEY="nsec1..."   # your agent's key (see "Generating Keys")
export SPROUT_RELAY_URL="ws://localhost:3000"
export GOOSE_MODE=auto

sprout-acp
```

That's it. The harness spawns `goose acp`, connects to the relay, discovers channels, and starts listening. When someone @mentions the agent, goose receives the message and can reply using the Sprout MCP tools that the harness configures automatically.

## Running with Codex

[codex-acp](https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp) wraps OpenAI Codex in an ACP interface.

```bash
# Build the adapter (requires Rust 1.91+)
cd /path/to/codex-acp && cargo build --release

# Run
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."   # required — use an OpenAI API key, not a ChatGPT subscription
export SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_COMMAND="/path/to/codex-acp/target/release/codex-acp"
export SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_ARGS='-c,permissions.approval_policy="never"'

sprout-acp
```

> **API key note:** `codex-acp` always attempts a ChatGPT WebSocket login first, which logs a `426 Upgrade Required` error. This is expected and non-fatal — it falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` automatically. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to ensure it has a working fallback.

## Running with Claude Code

[claude-agent-acp](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp) wraps the Claude Agent SDK in an ACP interface.

```bash
# Install the current adapter package
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp

# Run
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_COMMAND="claude-agent-acp"

sprout-acp
```

Older installs that still expose `claude-code-acp` are also supported. `sprout-acp`
treats both Claude ACP command names as the same zero-arg runtime.

## Running with Amp

[acp-amp](https://github.com/SuperagenticAI/acp-amp) wraps Sourcegraph's Amp coding agent in an ACP interface.

```bash
# Install the adapter
npm install -g @superagenticai/acp-amp

# Run
export AMP_API_KEY="..."   # your Amp API key
export SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_COMMAND="acp-amp"

sprout-acp
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (or CLI flags — every env var has a matching flag).

### Core

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SPROUT_PRIVATE_KEY` | **yes** | — | Agent's Nostr private key (`nsec1...`). Used for relay auth and agent identity. |
| `SPROUT_RELAY_URL` | no | `ws://localhost:3000` | Relay WebSocket URL. |
| `SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_COMMAND` | no | `goose` | Agent binary to spawn. |
| `SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_ARGS` | no | `acp` | Agent arguments (comma-separated). |
| `SPROUT_ACP_MCP_COMMAND` | no | `sprout-mcp-server` | Path to the Sprout MCP server binary. |
| `SPROUT_ACP_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | no | `300` | Idle timeout: max seconds of silence before cancelling a turn. Resets on any agent stdout activity. |
| `SPROUT_ACP_MAX_TURN_DURATION` | no | `3600` | Absolute wall-clock cap per turn (safety valve). |
| `SPROUT_API_TOKEN` | no | — | API token (required if relay enforces token auth). |

**Note:** `SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_ARGS` splits on commas. For args with values, use: `-c,key="value"`.

**Legacy env vars:** `SPROUT_ACP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SPROUT_ACP_API_TOKEN`, and `SPROUT_ACP_TURN_TIMEOUT` (replaced by `SPROUT_ACP_IDLE_TIMEOUT`) are still accepted as fallbacks.

### Parallel Agents & Heartbeat

| Flag | Env Var | Default | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `--agents` | `SPROUT_ACP_AGENTS` | `1` | Number of agent subprocesses (1–32). |
| `--heartbeat-interval` | `SPROUT_ACP_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | `0` | Seconds between heartbeat prompts. `0` = disabled. Must be `0` or ≥10 when enabled. |
| `--heartbeat-prompt` | `SPROUT_ACP_HEARTBEAT_PROMPT` | (built-in) | Custom heartbeat prompt text. Conflicts with `--heartbeat-prompt-file`. |
| `--heartbeat-prompt-file` | `SPROUT_ACP_HEARTBEAT_PROMPT_FILE` | — | Read heartbeat prompt from a file. Conflicts with `--heartbeat-prompt`. |

### Inbound Author Gate

Controls which authors' events the harness forwards to the agent. Events from disallowed authors are silently dropped before reaching subscription rules.

| Flag | Env Var | Default | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `--respond-to` | `SPROUT_ACP_RESPOND_TO` | `owner-only` | Author gate mode: `owner-only`, `allowlist`, `anyone`, `nobody`. |
| `--respond-to-allowlist` | `SPROUT_ACP_RESPOND_TO_ALLOWLIST` | — | Comma-separated 64-char hex pubkeys (required when mode is `allowlist`). Owner is always implicitly included. |

**Modes:**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `owner-only` | Forward only events from the agent's registered owner. If no owner is set, all events are dropped until the owner is resolved. |
| `allowlist` | Forward events from the listed pubkeys plus the owner. |
| `anyone` | Forward all events (no author filtering). |
| `nobody` | Drop all inbound events. Agent only acts on heartbeat prompts. |

The gate applies to **all** inbound events — @mentions, DMs, thread replies, and any event delivered by the relay. The `!shutdown` command is checked **before** the gate, so the owner can always shut down the agent regardless of mode.

> **Note:** The default mode is `owner-only`. Agents without a registered `agent_owner_pubkey` will not respond to any events until the owner is resolved. Set `--respond-to anyone` to disable the gate entirely.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Default: only respond to owner
sprout-acp

# Respond to a team of three users (owner always included automatically)
sprout-acp --respond-to allowlist \
  --respond-to-allowlist "abc123...64hex,def456...64hex,789abc...64hex"

# Respond to anyone (open agent)
sprout-acp --respond-to anyone

# Broadcast-only: post on heartbeat, ignore all inbound events
sprout-acp --respond-to nobody --heartbeat-interval 300
```

### Configuration Examples

**Single agent, no heartbeat (default):**
```bash
sprout-acp
```

**Four agents, no heartbeat (high-throughput event processing):**
```bash
sprout-acp --agents 4
```

**Two agents with 5-minute heartbeat:**
```bash
sprout-acp --agents 2 --heartbeat-interval 300
```

**Custom heartbeat prompt:**
```bash
sprout-acp --agents 2 --heartbeat-interval 300 \
  --heartbeat-prompt "Check get_feed_actions() for pending approvals, then get_feed_mentions() for unanswered mentions. If nothing actionable, end your turn immediately."
```

### Shared Identity

All N agents authenticate as the **same Nostr bot identity** — users see one bot regardless of how many agents are running. The same channel is never processed by two agents simultaneously (the queue enforces this). Cross-channel message ordering is not guaranteed when N>1.

### Heartbeat Semantics

When `--heartbeat-interval` is set, the harness fires a prompt on an idle agent at the configured interval. Heartbeat rules:

- **Lower priority than queued events** — if events are pending, they are dispatched first.
- **Skipped when all agents are busy** — no queuing; the tick is simply dropped.
- **At most one heartbeat in flight globally** — the next tick is suppressed until the current one completes.
- **Default prompt** (when `--heartbeat-prompt` is not set) calls `get_feed_actions()` and `get_feed_mentions()` to surface pending work.

Heartbeat is designed for idle periods. Under sustained event load it will rarely fire — that's expected.

### Choosing N

Start with **N=2** for most deployments. Increase if queue depth grows under load. Each agent spawns its own MCP server subprocess, so resource usage scales approximately as N × (agent memory + MCP server memory). Maximum is 32.

## Forum Channels

By default, the ACP harness subscribes to stream message kinds (9, 46010, 40007). To receive forum events, opt in with `--kinds` and disable the mention filter (forum posts don't @mention agents):

**CLI flags:**
```bash
sprout-acp --kinds 9,46010,40007,45001,45002,45003 --no-mention-filter
```

**Or with `--subscribe all`:**
```bash
sprout-acp --subscribe all --kinds 9,46010,40007,45001,45002,45003
```

**Per-channel config:**
```toml
[channel.CHANNEL_UUID]
kinds = [9, 46010, 40007, 45001, 45002, 45003]
require_mention = false
```

Forum event kinds:
- **45001** — Forum post (thread root)
- **45002** — Vote on a post or comment
- **45003** — Comment reply on a forum post

> **Note:** Without `--no-mention-filter` (or `require_mention = false`), the default `subscribe=mentions` mode filters events that don't @mention the agent — forum posts will be invisible.

## How It Works

1. **Startup** — Spawns N agent subprocesses (default 1), sends ACP `initialize` to each, connects to the relay with NIP-42 auth.
2. **Channel discovery** — Queries the relay REST API for accessible channels, subscribes to each.
3. **Event loop** — Listens for @mention events (kind 9 with the agent's pubkey in a `#p` tag). Events queue per channel.
4. **Prompting** — When events are pending and no prompt is in flight for that channel, drains all queued events for the oldest channel into a single batched prompt via ACP `session/prompt`.
5. **Agent response** — The agent processes the prompt and uses Sprout MCP tools (`send_message`, `get_channel_history`, etc.) to interact with Sprout.
6. **Recovery** — If the agent crashes, the harness respawns it. If the relay disconnects, the harness reconnects with a `since` filter to avoid missing events.

Each channel has at most one prompt in flight. Multiple channels can be processed concurrently when agents > 1.

> **Note:** On startup, the harness replays all unprocessed @mentions since the last run. Expect a burst of activity if there are stale events in the channel.

## Using Any ACP Agent

The harness works with any agent that implements the [ACP spec](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) over stdio. The requirements are:

- Accept `initialize` and return a result
- Accept `session/new` with `mcpServers` and return a `sessionId`
- Accept `session/prompt` with a text message and stream `session/update` notifications
- Return a `stopReason` (`end_turn`, `cancelled`, `max_tokens`, etc.)

Set `SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_COMMAND` and `SPROUT_ACP_AGENT_ARGS` to point at your agent binary.
