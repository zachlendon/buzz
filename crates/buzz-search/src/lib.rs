//! Buzz search — community-scoped Postgres full-text search over Buzz events.
//!
//! The index lives in the `events` table: `search_tsv TSVECTOR GENERATED
//! ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('simple', content)) STORED`, with `GIN
//! (search_tsv)` as the access path. Because the column is `GENERATED ALWAYS`,
//! every row write *is* the index update — there is no separate indexer, no
//! mpsc queue, no reindex job, no consistency window to reason about. A
//! client cannot forge the tsvector out of sync with the content it signed.
//!
//! This crate is the **query** side. Indexing is the SQL row insert — owned
//! by `buzz-db`. The relay refetches canonical events through `buzz-db`'s
//! scoped fetcher and runs access checks per hit; search is never the access
//! boundary (conformance row 50).
//!
//! ## Multi-tenant fence
//!
//! Every [`SearchQuery`] carries a [`CommunityId`]. There is no construction
//! path through this crate that omits it, and every SQL execution binds
//! `community_id = $ctx` as the first predicate. A query bound to community
//! A cannot return events stored under community B, by construction.
