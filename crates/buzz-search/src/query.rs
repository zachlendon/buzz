//! NIP-50 search query against Postgres FTS, community-scoped.
//!
//! The relay never trusts a hit by itself: this layer returns canonical event
//! ids ordered by relevance, the relay refetches `StoredEvent`s through
//! buzz-db's `(community_id, event_id)` scoped fetcher, and runs the access
//! predicate (`search_hit_accepted` in `bridge.rs`) per hit. Search is never
//! the access boundary — it cannot widen visibility.
//!
//! See conformance row 50.

/// | accessible | include_global | `ChannelScope` |
