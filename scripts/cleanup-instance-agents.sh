# Reap the agent processes belonging to a single desktop instance.
#
# `tauri dev` Ctrl+C tears down the Rust app before its in-process system sweep
# can finish, so agent workers (goose, sprout-agent, ...) it spawned in their
# own process groups survive as orphans. This script is the shell-side backstop:
# run it from an EXIT trap in the `just dev`/`just staging` recipes.
#
# It reads the PID-file receipts the desktop already writes — one file per agent
# under `<app-data>/agents/agent-pids/<pubkey>.pid`, each containing the agent's
# PGID (agents are spawned with `process_group(0)`, so PID == PGID). Killing by
# PGID reaches the whole agent subtree. We deliberately do NOT match the
# `SPROUT_MANAGED_AGENT` env var from the shell: on macOS `pkill -f` matches only
# argv, not the environment, so an env-marker match silently reaps nothing.
#
# Scoping is exact because the app-data directory is keyed by the instance's
# bundle identifier, so this only ever touches the receipts this instance wrote
# (the main checkout never reaps a worktree's agents, or vice versa).
#
# Usage: cleanup-instance-agents.sh <instance-id>
#   <instance-id> is the desktop bundle identifier, e.g. `xyz.block.sprout.app.dev`
#   (main checkout) or `xyz.block.sprout.app.dev.my-branch` (a worktree).
