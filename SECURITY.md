# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability in Buzz, use GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/block/buzz/security/advisories/new).
Include as much detail as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept (if available)
- The affected version(s) or commit range
- Any suggested mitigations you've identified

Maintainers will acknowledge the report through the private advisory and keep
you informed as they investigate and prepare a fix.

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to address the issue before any public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying data that does not belong to you
- Not perform denial-of-service attacks or disrupt production systems

We will credit reporters in release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| `main` (latest) | ✅ Active |
| Previous releases | ⚠️ Best-effort; upgrade recommended |

Buzz is pre-1.0. We do not maintain long-term support branches at this stage.
All security fixes land on `main` first.

## Security Design Principles

### Authentication — NIP-42

Every connection to the relay must authenticate via
[NIP-42](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/42.md)
challenge/response before writing events. The relay sends a random challenge;
the client signs a `kind:22242` event containing the challenge and the relay
URL, proving possession of the private key.

REST endpoints authenticate via
[NIP-98](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/98.md) HTTP Auth —
the client signs a `kind:27235` event containing the request URL and method.
The relay verifies the Schnorr signature and extracts the pubkey.

### Authorization and Community Boundaries

Community and channel membership form the primary content-access boundary.
Authenticated principals can read or write channel content only when their
community role and channel membership authorize the operation. Operator,
moderation, workflow, media, and git operations apply additional route-specific
authorization checks.

Private channels are invisible to non-members: they do not appear in channel
listings, and subscription filters for private channel events return nothing
unless the subscriber is a member.

### Append-Only Audit Log

All events are written to a tamper-evident audit log (`buzz-audit`). Each
log entry is chained to the previous one via a SHA-256 hash chain. Because the
chain is keyless, it is tamper-evident but not tamper-resistant: it detects
accidental corruption or single-row edits, but an attacker with database write
access can recompute the entire chain after editing. The audit log provides
integrity evidence; it is not a substitute for protected backups or independent
audit storage.

### Desktop Secret Storage — OS Keyring

The Buzz desktop app stores nsec private keys in the operating system keyring
rather than in plaintext files: macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or
the Linux Secret Service (`gnome-keyring` / `kwallet` via D-Bus). This covers
both the human identity key and every managed-agent key.

On first launch after upgrading, existing plaintext keys are migrated into the
keyring: the key is imported, read back to verify the round-trip, and only then
is the plaintext deleted. Migration runs only when the keyring is reachable —
if the backend is unavailable that session, the app keeps reading from the
plaintext file and does **not** migrate, so a transient outage cannot resurrect
a rotated key from a leftover file.

When no keyring backend is available (headless Linux with no Secret Service, for
example), keys fall back to a `0o600` owner-only file. The `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY`
environment variable, when set, always takes precedence over both stores — this
is how harnessed agents and CI receive their identity.

### Input Validation

- All UUIDs (channel IDs, workflow IDs) are validated at API boundaries before
  use in database queries.
- Workflow `call_webhook` actions are SSRF-protected: the target URL is
  resolved and checked against a blocklist of private/loopback address ranges
  before the request is made.
- Workflow response bodies are size-limited to prevent memory exhaustion.
- `evalexpr` condition evaluation is sandboxed and timeout-bounded.
- Query parameters passed to external URLs are percent-encoded to prevent
  injection.

### Transport Security

All production deployments should terminate TLS at the relay or a reverse
proxy in front of it. The relay itself does not enforce TLS — this is
intentional to allow flexible deployment behind load balancers and ingress
controllers.

### Dependency Management

We use `cargo audit` in CI to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
`#![deny(unsafe_code)]` is enforced across all crates — no unsafe Rust.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow [coordinated disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure).
Once a fix is ready and released, we will publish a security advisory on
GitHub describing the vulnerability, its impact, and the fix. Reporters will
be credited unless they request anonymity.
