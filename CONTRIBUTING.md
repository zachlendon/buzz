## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Rust | 1.88+ | Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) |
| Node.js | 24+ | Required for desktop app commands and `just ci` |
| pnpm | 10+ | Required for desktop app commands and `just ci` |
| Flutter | 3.41+ | Required for mobile app — install via [flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) |
| Docker | 24+ | For Postgres, Redis, Typesense |
| `just` | latest | Task runner — `cargo install just` |
| `lefthook` | latest | Optional; run `lefthook install` for local Git hooks |
| `sqlx` migrations | workspace crate | `just migrate` applies embedded migrations from `migrations/` |

This repo uses [Hermit](https://cashapp.github.io/hermit/) for toolchain
pinning. Activate it once per shell session:

```bash
. ./bin/activate-hermit
```

Hermit pins Rust, `just`, and other tools to the versions in `bin/`. If you
don't use Hermit, make sure your Rust toolchain meets the minimum version.

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/block/sprout.git
cd sprout

# 2. Activate Hermit (optional but recommended)
. ./bin/activate-hermit

# 3. Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Start infrastructure + run migrations
just setup

# 5. Install Git hooks (optional, recommended)
lefthook install
```

`just setup` starts Docker services (Postgres on `:5432`, Redis on `:6379`,
Typesense on `:8108`, Adminer on `:8082`, Keycloak on `:8180` for local
OAuth/OIDC testing, MinIO on `:9000` for media storage, and Prometheus on
`:9090` for metrics) and runs all pending database migrations.

### Running the Relay

```bash
just relay
# or: cargo run -p buzz-relay
```

The relay listens on `ws://localhost:3000` by default. You should see log
output confirming the WebSocket server is up and migrations have run.

### Stopping / Resetting

```bash
just down    # Stop Docker services, keep data
just reset   # ⚠️  Wipe all data and recreate the environment
```

---

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests (no infrastructure required)

```bash
just test-unit
```

Unit tests are self-contained and run without Docker. They cover event
parsing, filter matching, auth logic, workflow YAML parsing, and more.

### Integration Tests (requires running infrastructure)

```bash
just test
```

Integration tests spin up the relay and exercise the full stack — WebSocket
connections, NIP-42 auth, event ingestion, search indexing, and workflow
execution. `just test` starts Docker services automatically if they're not
already running.

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests live in `crates/buzz-test-client/tests/`:

- `e2e_rest_api.rs` — REST API tests
- `e2e_relay.rs` — WebSocket relay tests
- `e2e_mcp.rs` — MCP tool tests
- `e2e_nostr_interop.rs` — Nostr protocol interoperability tests
- `e2e_tokens.rs` — token management tests
- `e2e_media.rs` — media upload/download tests
- `e2e_media_extended.rs` — extended media tests (GIF, image processing)
- `e2e_workflows.rs` — workflow tests

Run them with (requires running infrastructure):

```bash
cargo test -p buzz-test-client -- --ignored
```

See `TESTING.md` for the full multi-agent E2E testing guide.

### CI Gate

Before opening a PR, run the full CI gate locally:

```bash
just ci
# Runs: check + unit tests + desktop build + Tauri check + mobile tests
```

This is the same check that runs in CI. PRs that fail `just ci` will not be
merged.

---

## Code Style

### Formatting

We use `rustfmt` with default settings. Format your code before committing:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
```

To check without modifying:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### Linting

We use `clippy` with warnings-as-errors:

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Fix all clippy warnings before submitting a PR. If you believe a warning is
a false positive, add a targeted `#[allow(...)]` with a comment explaining
why.

### No Unsafe Code

All crates enforce `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`. Do not add unsafe blocks. If you
believe unsafe is genuinely necessary, open an issue first to discuss the
approach.

### Error Handling

- Use `thiserror` for library error types.
- Use `anyhow` for binary / application-level error propagation.
- Do not use `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code paths. Use `?` or
  explicit error handling. `unwrap()` is acceptable in tests.

### Logging and Tracing

Use the `tracing` crate for all instrumentation. Prefer structured fields
over string interpolation:

```rust
// Good
tracing::info!(channel_id = %id, event_kind = kind, "Event ingested");

// Avoid
tracing::info!("Event ingested: channel={id} kind={kind}");
```

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(mcp): add get_feed_actions tool
fix(auth): reject expired NIP-42 challenges
docs(agents): document workflow MCP tools
refactor(db): extract channel queries into channel.rs
test(workflow): add approval gate integration test
```

The type prefix (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`) is
required. The scope (in parentheses) is optional but encouraged.

## Making a Pull Request

### Before You Start

- Check open issues and PRs to avoid duplicate work.
- For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
- For small fixes (typos, doc improvements, obvious bugs), go ahead and open
  a PR directly.

### What a Good PR Looks Like

1. **Focused** — one logical change per PR. If you're fixing a bug and
   refactoring a module, split them into two PRs.

2. **Tested** — new behavior has tests. Bug fixes include a regression test.
   If a test is impractical, explain why in the PR description.

3. **Documented** — public APIs, new event kinds, new MCP tools, and new
   config variables are documented. Update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or
   `VISION.md` as appropriate.

4. **CI passing** — `just ci` passes locally before you push.

5. **Clear description** — the PR description explains:
   - What problem this solves (or what feature it adds)
   - How it was implemented (key decisions, trade-offs)
   - How to test it manually (if applicable)
   - Any follow-up work deferred to a future PR

### PR Checklist

```
- [ ] `just ci` passes (fmt + clippy + unit tests + mobile)
- [ ] Integration tests pass (`just test`)
- [ ] New public APIs / tools / endpoints are documented
- [ ] No new `unwrap()` in production code paths
- [ ] No new `unsafe` blocks
```

### Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR within a few business days.
- Address review comments by pushing new commits (don't force-push during
  review; it makes it hard to see what changed).
- Once approved, a maintainer will squash-merge your PR.

## Architecture Overview

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full system design and
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#repo-structure) for the complete crate map. The key
design principles:

**The relay is the single source of truth.** All state flows through the
event store. Crates communicate through the database and Redis pub/sub — not
through direct function calls across crate boundaries (with the exception
of `buzz-core` types, which are shared everywhere).

**Event kinds are the only switch.** Every action in the system — a message,
a reaction, a workflow step, a canvas update — is a Nostr event with a kind
integer. Adding a new feature means defining a new kind. No breaking changes
to existing clients.

---

## Ecosystem

Buzz is developed across multiple repositories. This repo (`block/sprout`)
is the open-source home for all application code — the relay, desktop app,
mobile app, CLI, and agent harness. Internal repositories handle
enterprise-signed builds and infrastructure deployment.

See [AGENTS.md § Ecosystem](AGENTS.md#ecosystem) for the full repo table and
dependency diagram.

**External contributors:** Fork `block/sprout`, open a PR, and CI runs
automatically. No special access is required.

**Block team members:** See the internal
[sprout-releases CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/squareup/sprout-releases/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for team access setup, onboarding, and the full repo inventory. See
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the release process.

## How to Add a New Event Kind

1. **Define the kind constant** in `buzz-core/src/kind.rs`:

   ```rust
   /// My new event kind — description of what it represents.
   pub const KIND_MY_FEATURE: u32 = 4XXXX;
   ```

   Pick a kind number in the appropriate sub-range defined in `kind.rs`.
   Check the `ALL_KINDS` array for collisions. Each sub-range is documented
   with comments in the file.

2. **Define the payload type** in the appropriate module in `buzz-core/src/`
   (e.g., alongside `event.rs`) if the content field is structured JSON:

   ```rust
   #[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct MyFeaturePayload {
       pub field_one: String,
       pub field_two: Option<u64>,
   }
   ```

3. **Register the kind's required scope** in
   `crates/buzz-relay/src/handlers/ingest.rs` inside
   `required_scope_for_kind()`. This controls which auth scope a caller
   needs to submit the event:

   ```rust
   KIND_MY_FEATURE => Ok(Scope::MessagesWrite),
   ```

4. **Handle post-storage side effects** by adding a match arm in
   `crates/buzz-relay/src/handlers/side_effects.rs` inside
   `handle_side_effects()`:

   ```rust
   KIND_MY_FEATURE => handle_my_feature(event, state).await?,
   ```

   `handle_side_effects()` runs after the event is stored — use it for
   notifications, cache invalidation, or derived data. If the new kind
   also needs a REST surface (e.g., a query endpoint for clients), add a
   handler in `crates/buzz-relay/src/api/` and register it in
   `crates/buzz-relay/src/router.rs`.

5. **Persist to the database** — if the event needs to be queryable, add a
   handler in `buzz-db/src/` (e.g., `buzz-db/src/my_feature.rs`) with
   the appropriate `INSERT` and `SELECT` queries.

6. **Index for search** (if applicable) — add the kind to the Typesense
   indexing logic in `buzz-search/src/index.rs`.

7. **Audit** — the audit log captures all events automatically; no changes
   needed unless you need custom audit metadata.

8. **Write tests** — add a unit test for payload serialization in
   `buzz-core` and an integration test in `buzz-test-client` that sends
   the new event kind and verifies the expected behavior.

9. **Document** — `kind.rs` is the authoritative registry of all kind numbers.
   Update `README.md` if it's a user-facing feature.

## How to Add a New API Endpoint

REST endpoints live in `crates/buzz-relay/src/api/` — each resource has
its own submodule (e.g., `channels.rs`, `messages.rs`, `tokens.rs`). Routes
are registered in `crates/buzz-relay/src/router.rs`.

1. **Define the handler function:**

   ```rust
   pub async fn get_my_resource(
       State(state): State<Arc<AppState>>,
       headers: HeaderMap,
       Path(channel_id_str): Path<String>,
   ) -> Result<Json<serde_json::Value>, (StatusCode, Json<serde_json::Value>)> {
       let channel_id = uuid::Uuid::parse_str(&channel_id_str)
           .map_err(|_| api_error(StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST, "invalid channel_id"))?;
       let ctx = extract_auth_context(&headers, &state).await?;
       buzz_auth::require_scope(&ctx.scopes, buzz_auth::Scope::ChannelsRead)
           .map_err(scope_error)?;
       let pubkey_bytes = ctx.pubkey_bytes.clone();
       check_token_channel_access(&ctx, &channel_id)?;
       check_channel_access(&state, channel_id, &pubkey_bytes).await?;
       // Fetch data
       let data = state.db.get_my_resource(channel_id).await
           .map_err(|e| internal_error(&e.to_string()))?;
       Ok(Json(serde_json::json!(data)))
   }
   ```

2. **Register the route** in `crates/buzz-relay/src/router.rs`:

   ```rust
   .route("/api/channels/{channel_id}/my-resource", get(get_my_resource))
   ```

3. **Add the database query** in `buzz-db/src/` — follow the existing
   patterns in `channel.rs`, `event.rs`, etc.

4. **Handle errors** — use the `api_error()` and `internal_error()` helpers in
   `buzz-relay/src/api/mod.rs`. Return `(StatusCode, Json<Value>)` tuples.

5. **Write tests** — add an integration test using the `buzz-test-client`
   harness in `crates/buzz-test-client/tests/e2e_rest_api.rs`.

6. **Document** — if the endpoint is part of the public API surface, add it
   to the API reference section of `README.md` or a dedicated `API.md`.
