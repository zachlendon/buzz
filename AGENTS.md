## Getting Started

```bash
. ./bin/activate-hermit   # activate hermit toolchain (Rust, Node, etc.)
cp .env.example .env      # configure local environment
just setup                # install deps, run migrations
just relay                # start relay at ws://localhost:3000
just ci                   # run before any PR
```

See CONTRIBUTING.md for full setup details and dependency requirements.

## Quality Gates

Run `just ci` before every PR — it runs `fmt` + `clippy` + desktop lint +
unit tests + builds. Clippy passing does not mean fmt passes; run both.

Run `just test` for integration tests if you touched `sprout-relay`,
`sprout-db`, or `sprout-auth` — these require a running Postgres and Redis.

**Pre-commit and pre-push hooks** are installed automatically by `just setup`.
Pre-commit runs 5 checks in parallel on every `git commit` (Rust fmt, Tauri Rust
fmt, desktop lint, web lint, mobile fmt) — a commit will fail if any are dirty.
Pre-push runs the full CI gate: all pre-commit checks plus clippy, unit tests,
desktop build, Tauri check, web build, and mobile tests (~minutes). Run
`just fmt-all` before committing to auto-fix all formatting in one shot. Run
`just hooks` to re-install hooks after env changes.

Additional rules:
- No `unsafe` code
- Do not introduce new `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production paths — use `?` and proper error types
- New public API must have doc comments

## Key Patterns

**Dual API surface**: Sprout exposes both a REST API and a NIP-29 WebSocket
relay. Both paths converge on shared DB functions in `sprout-db`. When adding
a feature, implement the shared DB logic first, then wire up both surfaces.

**Prefer Nostr events over new REST endpoints**: For new feature work, model
the operation as a Nostr event (new kind in `sprout-core/src/kind.rs`, handler
in `sprout-relay`) rather than adding a new REST endpoint. REST is reserved
for things that genuinely need an HTTP-only surface: media upload/download
(Blossom), OAuth callbacks, health checks, and the existing read endpoints
that proxy DB queries. Two helpful endpoints already exist and rarely need
to be duplicated:

- `POST /events` — submit any signed event (same path the WebSocket uses).
- `POST /query` — Nostr REQ filters over HTTP. NIP-50 `search` filters
  are routed to `sprout-search` (Typesense-backed) automatically.
- `POST /count` — Nostr COUNT filters over HTTP.

If you find yourself reaching for a new REST endpoint, first check whether
an event kind would do the job — it usually will, and you get realtime
fan-out, NIP-29 scoping, and the existing auth pipeline for free.

Reference https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips

**Event kinds**: All event kind integers are defined in
`sprout-core/src/kind.rs`. New features get new kind integers — add them here
first, then implement handling in the relay.

**Channel scoping**: Channels use `h` tags (NIP-29 group tag), not `e` tags.
Filters and queries must scope to `h` tags when operating within a channel.

**Agent-facing operations go in `sprout-cli`, not `sprout-mcp`**: `sprout-mcp`
is being phased out. New agent-facing features belong in `sprout-cli` — add a
subcommand there first, then wire the REST/WebSocket call in `client.rs`. Do
not add new tools to `sprout-mcp` unless specifically required for backward
compatibility. `sprout-dev-mcp` (shell + file tools for `sprout-agent`) is
separate and not being phased out.

**Workflow conditions**: `sprout-workflow` uses
[evalexpr](https://docs.rs/evalexpr) for condition evaluation. Keep expressions
simple and testable.

**Thread counters**: `reply_count` and `descendant_count` are materialized on
thread root events. Any code that inserts replies must update these counters —
check existing reply handlers for the pattern.

## Agent CLI (`sprout-cli`)

`sprout` is the agent-first CLI replacing `sprout-mcp`. Auth env vars
(`SPROUT_RELAY_URL`, `SPROUT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SPROUT_AUTH_TAG`) are auto-injected
by the ACP harness into managed agent subprocesses.

All reads return sig-stripped JSON arrays; all writes return
`{event_id, accepted, message}`; creates add the entity ID. Exit codes:
0=ok, 1=input error, 2=network/relay, 3=auth, 4=other, 5=write conflict (NIP-33 LWW).

`--format compact` is a **global** flag — it goes before the subcommand:
`sprout --format compact channels list`, NOT `sprout channels list --format compact`.

See `crates/sprout-cli/TESTING.md` for the full live-testing runbook.

## Testing

```bash
just test-unit    # unit tests, no infrastructure needed
just test         # full integration suite (requires Postgres + Redis)
```

E2E tests live in `crates/sprout-test-client/tests/`:
- `e2e_relay.rs` — WebSocket relay protocol
- `e2e_rest_api.rs` — REST endpoint coverage
- `e2e_mcp.rs` — MCP tool surface
- `e2e_tokens.rs` — auth token flows
- `e2e_workflows.rs` — workflow engine
- `e2e_media.rs` — media upload/download (Blossom)
- `e2e_media_extended.rs` — extended media scenarios
- `e2e_nostr_interop.rs` — Nostr interop (NIP-50 search, NIP-10 threads, NIP-17 gift wraps)

Desktop E2E: `cd desktop && pnpm exec playwright test`

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full multi-agent E2E guide.

## Common Gotchas

1. **Kind `39000` for channel metadata, not `41`** — kind 41 is NIP-01 (unused). All kinds defined in `sprout-core/src/kind.rs`.
2. **Relay queries must specify `kinds`** — omitting `kinds` triggers the p-gate (403). Always include explicit kind filters.
3. **`messages search` must include `--kinds`** — an open-ended search (no kinds) hits the relay p-gate and returns 403. Pass at least `--kinds 9,45001,45003` to scope the query.
4. **Worktrees: `cd` in the same command** — shell CWD doesn't persist between tool calls. Use `cd /path && cargo build` as one command.
5. **Desktop crate excluded from root workspace** — `cargo test` at repo root does NOT run desktop tests. Use `cargo test --manifest-path desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` explicitly.
6. **Desktop fmt check fails in worktrees and blocks commits** — the pre-commit hook runs `just desktop-tauri-fmt-check`, which fails in git worktrees because `cargo fmt` resolves workspace paths relative to the worktree root. Run `just desktop-tauri-fmt` from the main checkout to apply the fix, then re-stage and commit. CI is unaffected.

## Desktop App

The desktop app is Tauri 2 + React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS. Features are
organized under `desktop/src/features/`. Biome handles linting and formatting.

```bash
just desktop-dev   # web-only dev server (faster iteration)
just desktop-app   # full Tauri app with native shell
```

### Workspace Switching

The desktop app supports multiple workspaces (each backed by a different relay).
Switching workspaces does **not** reload the page — it uses React key-based
remounting. `<AppReady key={workspaceKey} />` in `App.tsx` forces the entire
workspace-scoped subtree to unmount and remount with fresh state.

**Module-level singletons must be explicitly reset.** React remounting only
clears React state (useState, useRef, context). Module-level variables (Maps,
class instances, cached promises) survive across remounts. Every workspace-scoped
singleton needs a reset function wired into `resetWorkspaceState()` in
`desktop/src/features/workspaces/useWorkspaceInit.ts`.

Current singletons that are reset on workspace switch:
- `relayClient.disconnect()` — WebSocket teardown + promise rejection
- `resetMediaCaches()` — proxy port and relay origin caches
- `clearSearchHitEventCache()` — search result event cache
- `clearAllDrafts()` — message draft cache

**If you add a new module-level cache, Map, or class instance that holds
workspace-scoped data, you must add its reset to `resetWorkspaceState()`.**
Failure to do so causes data from the old workspace to leak into the new one.

Key files:
- `desktop/src/app/App.tsx` — workspace key, init gate, remount boundary
- `desktop/src/features/workspaces/useWorkspaceInit.ts` — `resetWorkspaceState()`, applies config to Tauri backend
- `desktop/src/features/workspaces/useWorkspaces.tsx` — `WorkspacesProvider` context (shared state for App + AppShell)
- `desktop/src/main.tsx` — provider hierarchy (`QueryClientProvider` > `WorkspacesProvider` > `App`)

---

## Mobile App (Flutter)

The mobile app lives in `mobile/` — a Flutter app using Riverpod + Hooks.

### Architecture

- **State management:** Riverpod + `flutter_hooks` (`HookConsumerWidget`)
- **Theme:** Catppuccin Latte (light) / Macchiato (dark) — matches desktop
- **Features:** Isolated under `lib/features/`, shared code in `lib/shared/`
- **Nostr models:** `lib/shared/relay/nostr_models.dart` — event kinds must
  stay in sync with `desktop/src/shared/constants/kinds.ts`

### Rules

- **NEVER use `StatefulWidget`** — always use `HookConsumerWidget` or
  `ConsumerWidget` with `flutter_hooks` for local state.
- **NEVER run `flutter run`, `flutter build`, `flutter clean`, or
  `flutter upgrade`** — only `flutter test`, `flutter analyze`, and
  `dart format` are safe for agents to run.
- **Do NOT use `print()`** — use `debugPrint()` or structured logging.
- Prefer `context.colors` and `context.textTheme` (via theme extensions)
  over raw `Theme.of(context)` calls.
- Keep widgets small and composable.
- Feature modules must not import from other feature modules — only from
  `shared/`.
- Use `Grid` tokens for spacing, `Radii` for border radius.

### Quality Checks

```bash
cd mobile
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Or from repo root: `just mobile-fmt` (auto-fix), `just mobile-check` (lint + fmt check), `just mobile-test` (tests).

### Testing Conventions

- Prefer **widget tests** over unit tests for UI components — test the
  whole widget tree, not individual methods.
- Use `ProviderScope(overrides: [...])` to inject fake notifiers.
- Fake notifiers should extend the real notifier class and override `build()`.
- Use the `WidgetHelpers.testable()` wrapper for simple widget tests or
  build a custom `ProviderScope` + `MaterialApp` when you need specific overrides.
